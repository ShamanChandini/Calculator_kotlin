# Calculator_kotlin
This is my first project.😁😁
I used Kotlin language in Android Studio. 
A calculator is any electronic gadget that allows you to solve math problems easily. 
It comes with a keyboard and a small visual display to input numbers.
Most calculators can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.
➕-Add
➖-Subtract
➗-Divide
❌-Multiplication
Calculators allow students to work more quickly, which means they can solve more problems in a given time.
