# Calculator_kotlin

> This is my first project.😁😁

I used Kotlin language in Android Studio. 

A calculator is any electronic gadget that allows you to solve math problems easily. 

It comes with a keyboard and a small visual display to input numbers.

Most calculators can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.

`` ➕-Add

➖-Subtract

➗-Divide

❌-Multiplication  ``

Calculators allow students to work more quickly, which means they can solve more problems in a given time.
